# UX

## User Stories

### As a user of this platform, I will be able to:
 
- Sign up to create an account
- Add payment information and make payments
- Login to the site
- See my previous bookings
- See my coming bookings
- Cancel bookings
- Make bookings

## Design

This project was developed with an idea of keeping it simple, keeping the bookings in focus.

### Typography
- The body font used is **Roboto**. Good readability and working well on smaller screens.
- The title of booking is a condensed version of **Roboto**. It keeps the feeling of simplicity while helping the tile be caught by the eye.
- Page title is **Staaliche** which suits well with **Roboto** in my opinion and also fits as a font for the page title.
